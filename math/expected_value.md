Random Walk problems: 

* try going one step and see what's the expected number of steps. 
* try out a recurrence relation. 
* if there is a game where it ends if you reach -a or b, and you start from 0. Expected number of moves = ab. 
* in general expected value problems seem difficult, try to make some observations to make it tractable instead of applying math directly.
* try symmetry
* also be aware of the contribution technique.

### Trick 1

* Expected value across integers = Sum .. i * P[i] = Sum ... P[>=i]
